# jSSTL: java Signal Spatio Temporal Logic
jSSTL is a Java library for the specification and verification of spatio-temporal properties of dynamical systems described as spatio-temporal traces over a weighted graph. Given a trace x(t,l), a weighted graph and a formula Phi, it returns the boolean and quantitative spatio-temporal signals of the satisfaction at each time and in each location.
